## About
This includes all my design projects created in Figma :zap: :pencil:

* I have always been curious about designing UI's and mockups :smiley:

* Through opensource contributions in Hacktoberfest 2020 , OpenSourceHack :v: my interest in this field grew even more and I started exploring more about the Figma Tool and AdobeXD
